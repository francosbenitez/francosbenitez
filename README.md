ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Franco SebastiÃ¡n BenÃ­tez! I'm an Frontend Developer passionate about development, design, and psychology. I love making things which work well, look good and are easy-to-use for everyone.

ðŸ§ Â I graduated from the University of Buenos Aires in 2021 with a licentiate degree in psychology (equivalent to a masterâ€™s degree). Given that Iâ€™ve always been interested in scientific research, Iâ€™ve always been related to development. Likewise, as Iâ€™m a very detailist person, the design part is another part of which Iâ€™m always very enthusiastic. 

ðŸ› Â Currently, my main tech stack revolve around Vue, Bootstrap, SASS, and Angular. 

ðŸ“– When Iâ€™m not staring at my computer, I like reading science or practicing calisthenics. I also enjoy playing football!
