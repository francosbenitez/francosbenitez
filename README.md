ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Franco, a psychology student at University of Buenos Aires (UBA).

ðŸ“ˆ Early, my interest toward psychological science brought me to be interested in statistics, methodology, and programming. 

ðŸ’» Here, you'll find the code of my projects done using R, Python, JavaScript, HTML & CSS.
