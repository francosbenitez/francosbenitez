👋 Hi there, I'm Franco Sebastián Benítez! I'm almost a psychologist who is passionate about data, design, and development. 

🔬 Due to my great interest in psychological research, I began to program and, since then, I have not stopped learning. I love creating user-centric products and working in an interdisciplinary way.

🏃‍♂️ When I’m not staring at my computer, I like to get outside for a walk, run or bike ride. I also enjoy playing football! 

😄 You can learn more about me through [my personal website](https://www.francosbenitez.com/). Feel free to contact me at [francosbenitez@gmail.com](mailto:francosbenitez@gmail.com).
