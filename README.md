👋 Hi there, I am Franco Sebastián Benítez! I am a Frontend Developer passionate about development, design, and psychology. I love making things which work well, look good and are easy-to-use for everyone.

👨‍💻 Along my psychology career and due to my great interest in scientific psychology, I started programming and found a world that I love. Since then, I have been loving creating software solutions which help people develop a product, an idea, or simply a passion.

🛠 Currently, my main tech stack revolve around Vue, Vuex, Bootstrap, and SASS. But I also enjoy working with React, Redux, Next, Nuxt, MySQL, Django, Flask, and Tailwind. 

⚽️ When I am not staring at my computer, I like practicing calisthenics or playing football!
