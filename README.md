Hi, nice to meet you! I'm a Frontend Developer passionate about development, design, and psychology. I love making things which work well, look good and are easy-to-use for everyone.

Along my psychology career and due to my great interest in scientific psychology, I started programming and found a world that I love. Since then, I have loved creating software solutions which help people develop a product, an idea, or simply a passion.

Currently, my favourite tech stack revolves around:
- Languages: TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, SCSS
- Frontend Frameworks: Next, React, Vue
- Backend Frameworks: Django, Express + Sequelize
- CSS Frameworks: Tailwind, Chakra
- Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL

When I'm not staring at my computer, I like practising calisthenics or playing football!
