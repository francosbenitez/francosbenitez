Hi, nice to meet you! I'm a Frontend Developer passionate about development, design, and psychology. I love making things which work well, look good and are easy-to-use for everyone.

Along my psychology career and due to my great interest in scientific psychology, I started programming and found a world that I love. Since then, I have loved creating software solutions which help people develop a product, an idea, or simply a passion.

Currently, my main tech stack revolve around Vue, Vuex, Bootstrap, and SASS. But I also enjoy working with React, Redux, Next, Nuxt, MySQL, Django, Node, Tailwind, and other stuff. 

When I'm not staring at my computer, I like practising calisthenics or playing football!
